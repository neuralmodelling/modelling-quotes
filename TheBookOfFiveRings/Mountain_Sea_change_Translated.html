  <p>さんかいのかわりと云ふ事。</p>
  <p>The Mountain-Sea Change</p>
  <p>山海の心と云ふは、敵、我戦いのうちに、同じ事を度々する事悪き所也。</p>
  <p>The “mountain-sea” spirit means that it is bad to repeat the same thing several times when fighting the enemy.</p>
  <p>同じ事二度は是非に及ばず。三度するにあらず。</p>
  <p>There may be no help but to do something twice, but do not try it a third time.</p>
  <p>敵にわざをしかくるに、一度にてもちいずば、今一つもせきかけて、其利に及ばず、</p>
  <p>If you once make an attack and fail, there is little chance of success if you use the same approach again.</p>
  <p>各別替りたる事を、ほつとしかけ、それにもはかゆかずば、亦各別の事をしかくべし。</p>
  <p>If you attempt a technique which you have previously tried unsuccessfully and fail yet again, then you must change your attacking method.<p>
  <p>然によって、敵山と思はば海としかけ、海と思はば山としかくる心、兵法の道也。</p>
  <p>If the enemy thinks of the mountains, attack like the sea; and if he thinks of the sea, attack like the mountains.</p>
  <p>能々吟味あるべき事也。</p>
  <p>You must research this deeply.</p>

<blockquote cite="">
Don’t repeat a mistake a third time.
It’s bad to repeat the same method several times.
To use a method twice is acceptable, but it should not be repeated a third time.
In the process of attacking an enemy, if you fail to succeed the first time, even if you try the same method twice, it will only add to your failure.
If you fail the first time you should try a different method the next time.
If you think of the enemy as a mountain, think of the sea; if you think of the enemy as the sea, think of the mountain.
In other words you should think of an opposite or a completely different method.
