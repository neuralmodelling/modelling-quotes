  <p>鼠頭,牛首。</p>
  <p>Rat's Head, Ox's Neck.</p>
  <p>鼠頭牛首と云ふは、</p>
  <p>"Rat's head and ox's neck" means that,</p>
  <p>敵と戦のうちに、</p>
  <p>when we are fighting with the enemy</p>
  <p>互に細かなる所を思ひ合はせて、縺るゝ心になる時、</p>
  <p>and both he and we have become occupied with small points in an entangled spirit,</p>
  <p>兵法の道をつねに鼠頭牛首、そとうごしゆと思ひて</p>
  <p>we must always think of the Way of strategy as being both a rat's head and an ox's neck.</p>
  <p>如何にも細かなるうちに</p>
  <p>Whenever we have become preoccupied with small detail,</p>
  <p>俄に大きなる心にして、</p>
  <p>we must suddenly change into a large spirit,</p>
  <p>大小にかわる事、</p>
  <p>interchanging large with small.</p>
  <p>兵法一つの心だて也。</p>
  <p>This is one of the essences of strategy.</p>
  <p>兵法大分小分にしても、此心を離るべからず。</p>
  <p>You must not depart from this spirit in large-scale strategy nor in single combat.</p>
