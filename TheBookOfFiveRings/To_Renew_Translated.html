  <p>あらたになると云事。</p>
  <p>To Renew</p>
  <p>新に成とは、敵我戦ふ時、</p>
  <p>“To renew” applies when we are fighting with the enemy,</p>
  <p>もつるゝ心になつて、はかゆかざる時、</p>
  <p>and an entangled spirit arises where there is no possible resolution. </p>
  <p>我が気を振捨て、物毎を新らしくはじむる心に思ひて、其拍子を受け勝をわきまゆる所也。</p>
  <p>We must abandon our efforts, think of the situation in a fresh spirit then win in the new rhythm.</p>
  <p>新に成る事は、何時も敵と我れきしむ心になると思はば、</p>
  <p>To renew, when we are deadlocked with the enemy,</p>
  <p>其儘心を替て、各別の利を以て勝つべき也。</p>
  <p>means that without changing our circumstance we change our spirit and win through a different technique. </p>
  <p>大分の兵法におゐても、新に成ると云所わきまゆる事肝要也。</p>
  <p>It is necessary to consider how “to renew” also applies in large-scale strategy. </p>
  <p>兵法の智力にては、忽ち見ゆる所也。</p>
  <p>With the wisdom of strategy, you should envision this in an instant.</p>

<blockquote>
While fighting with an enemy, if you find yourself in a bind and you cannot make a decisive move, you should abandon your intentions and start things over, by riding on a new spirit looking for a path to victory.
When you are in a situation where you are in deadlock with the enemy you should change you intentions and try to win the fight using a different method.
It is necessary to consider this even in large-scale battle.
If you have the techniques needed to become a master warrior, you should be able to make this judgment easily.
